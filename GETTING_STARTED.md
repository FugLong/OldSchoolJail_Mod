# Getting Started with Old School Jail Mod

## Testing the Mod Locally

1. **Build the mod:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```
   The built JAR will be in `build/libs/oldschooljail-1.0.0.jar`

2. **Test in a development environment:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew runServer
   ```

3. **Install on a server:**
   - Copy the JAR from `build/libs/` to your server's `mods` folder
   - Ensure Fabric API is installed
   - Start the server

## Setting Up Permissions with LuckPerms

1. **Install LuckPerms** on your server

2. **Grant permissions to staff:**
   ```
   /lp group admin permission set oldschooljail.jail true
   /lp group admin permission set oldschooljail.release true
   /lp group admin permission set oldschooljail.set true
   /lp group admin permission set oldschooljail.delete true
   ```

3. **Make VIPs immune to jailing:**
   ```
   /lp group vip permission set oldschooljail.immune true
   ```

## Creating Your First Jail

1. **Go to a jail location** and run:
   ```
   /jail set main
   ```

2. **Jail a player:**
   ```
   /jail PlayerName 30 Breaking the rules
   ```
   (30 minutes by default, configurable in config)

3. **Check remaining time** (as jailed player):
   ```
   /jail time
   ```

4. **Release early:**
   ```
   /jail release PlayerName
   ```

## Creating a GitHub Release

1. **Tag a version:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build the mod
   - Create a release
   - Upload the JAR file
